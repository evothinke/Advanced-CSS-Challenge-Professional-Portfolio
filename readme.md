<h2>The process</h2>

- creating the main files: index.html and style.css.
- creating the base html template and linking the css file.
- adding elements to the html (header, navigation, sections, footer etc.).
- structuring everything according to... common sense :)).
- adding various tags like the body, div, h, img, etc.
- styling everything in css.



<h2>Interesting facts</h2>

- the logo is clickable.
- the nav items change color when hovering.
- nav elements are used as anchors to scroll down to coinciding specific sections.
- the portfolio tiles are changing opacity, zooming in and turning when hovering over.
- the website is responsive to different aspect ratios.
